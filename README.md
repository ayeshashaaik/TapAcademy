# TapAcademy
This project is a static HTML clone of the TAP Academy official website, built entirely with HTML. It accurately replicates the original site's layout, structure, and key elements. Developed as a learning exercise, it highlights core HTML skills in creating a lightweight, responsive site without using CSS or JavaScript.
