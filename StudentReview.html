                        I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined <br>
                         Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey <br>
                          with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are <br>
                           skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in  <br>
                           learning programming languages from scratch.
                        <br> <br>
                        I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap <br>
                         Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all  <br>
                         domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the <br>
                          trainers.
                         <br> <br>
                        Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package <br>
                         of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
                        <br> <br>
                        Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this <br>
                         opportunity.

                        After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and <br>
                        my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the <br>
                         Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.
                        <br> <br>
                        Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. <br>
                         Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. <br>
                        They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, <br>
                         Data Structures, etc.
                        <br> <br>
                        I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate <br>
                         Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.
                        <br> <br>
                        Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.

                    Enrolling at TAP Academy Institute has been one of the best decisions <br>
                     for my educational and professional growth. The institute offers a <br>
                      holistic learning environment that caters to various aspects of my <br>
                       development as a student and aspiring professional. <br> <br>

                     willing to help. Their dedication to student success is evident in the <br>
                      personalized attention they provide. Whenever I faced challenges, 
                    I <br> knew I could rely on my instructors to offer guidance and support, <br>
                     making the learning process smoother and more enjoyable. <br> <br>
                    One of the standout features of TAP Academy is the TAI platform, <br>
                     dedicated to coding practice. This platform has been instrumental in <br>
                      enhancing my programming skills.
                     LMS at TAP Academy is another great asset. <br>
                     It centralizes all learning materials, assignments, and <br>
                      progress tracking in one place. The dedicated job portal connects <br>
                       students with potential employers, offering a direct pathway to <br>
                       internships and job placements. 
                     Through this portal, I have had the <br>
                      opportunity to apply my skills in a professional setting, which has been <br> crucial for my career development.
